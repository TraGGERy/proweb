              PROWEB Zimbabwe is a non-partisan civil forum established in 2005 to promote the economic empowerment of Zimbabwean women by providing a platform for networking, capacity building, policy advocacy, and personal as well as professional development.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              We champion the belief that women, as vital contributors to society, should be at the forefront of national development and eventually control a significant portion of the country's wealthâ€”envisioning a future where empowered women shape Zimbabwe's economic and social agenda.
